## Overview

Excel lightweight reporting tool


## Detailed Description

Excel lightweight reporting tool [GWT based](http://www.gwtproject.org/) application, which provides report geneneration in excel format. On the other hand Eliweirt demonstrates the capabilities of the set of libraries (for details see [Databuffer](https://github.com/khomisha/databuffer.git), [Dataservice](https://github.com/khomisha/dataservice.git), [UI](https://github.com/khomisha/ui.git)) on which it is based. Since reporting in most business applications is not the main purpose, then, for example, GWT application for a variety of business tasks can be obtained from Eliweirt by adding the required business functionality. The opposite issue (embedding reporting functionality into existing GWT application) can be solved by adding the [Dataservice](https://github.com/khomisha/dataservice.git) library in your project. For details [see](https://github.com/khomisha/eliweirt/blob/master/eliweirt.pdf)
